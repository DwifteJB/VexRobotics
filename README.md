# VexRobotics

This current robot is used to pickup fabric balls and to move them from x to y.

## Extra Details

The "writetoiqcpp" file allows the code.c++ to be written to the really bad iqcpp file.

## How to build

Run the writetoiqcpp.js (using nodejs (node ./src/build/writetoiqcpp.js)) then open the DSHSMistake.iqcpp in VexCode IQ and build through there!
## TODO

- [X] Allow motor to move with right thumbstick
- [] Clamp the motor using code
- [] Vision system for detecting object (maybe automatic system for grasping?)
